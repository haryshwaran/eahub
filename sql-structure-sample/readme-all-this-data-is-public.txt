All this data is public on eahub already. Please don't add non-public data.

This contains the structure for the most complex type of field (a multi-value checkbox), and also a simpler field. Because this is all 'donations' info, everything with the same entity_id belongs to the same user. This is the user with the 'uid' given in the 'profile' table. More user info's given in another table, but that contains confidential info. 

This is standard Drupal table format, with the profile2 module.
