# EA Hub

This is a Drupal site. The whole codebase is not yet in github, pending [someone adding it](https://github.com/tog22/eahub/issues/4). Instructions for getting a working local copy are being developed at https://github.com/tog22/eahub/wiki - though they're incomplete (at least as of July 19th 2015). You can also download Drupal 7 from https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal and play around with it (using Acquia Dev Desktop rather than your regular local AMP stack may be easier and smoother).
